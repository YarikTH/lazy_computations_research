List of different lazy evaluation c++ libraries:

* https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor
* https://github.com/jscheiny/Streams
* https://github.com/SaadAttieh/lazyCode
* https://github.com/MarcDirven/cpp-lazy
* https://github.com/tirimatangi/Lazy
* https://github.com/cwzx/lazy-iterators
* https://github.com/citybound-old/lzy
* https://github.com/hirthwork/lazy
* https://github.com/minamiyama1994/Lazy
* https://github.com/randrewy/Streams
* https://github.com/twentylemon/flow

Need to remember, that I want to join reactive programming with a lazy evaluation. So I work not with steam processing, but with a set of completly performed operations on the value.
